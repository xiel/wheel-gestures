// Disabling ESLint (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/eslint/#disabling-eslint)
// Creating an empty .eslintrc file at the root of your project will disable ESLint for your site.
// The empty file will disable the built-in eslint-loader because Gatsby assumes once you have an ESLint file you are in charge of linting.
// -> linting comes from the root project
